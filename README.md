# Get a beer 
Gets beers from the api, you can apply several filters using url paramaters, the available options are listed below.
to display it in the App with the information of the beer!

# The React
Using the plataform of react I build some backgorund and Front-End to show information about beers, using an API.
The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.

# React Native 
Using this example for getting the card and get information, in a best way I read it and code a better display information.
Note: If you are using react-native version 0.60 or higher you don't need to link react-native-vector-icons.

Wrap your root component in Provider from react-native-paper. If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to AppRegistry.registerComponent. 

If you don't want to install vector icons, you can use babel-plugin-optional-require to opt-out.

If you use Expo, you don't need to install vector icons. But if you have a babel.config.js or .babelrc file, make sure that it includes babel-preset-expo.

## Hooks for get the Data of the API that display the beer

To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into managing the component’s local state with a reducer to make it more predictable.
We’ll discuss this more in Using the Effect Hook.
