making an esasy display of the information of some beer where the people can get some amazing beer with the history of the beers

## React
Using the plataform of react I build some backgorund and Front-End to show information about beers, using an API.

# Use this Api to display the information
Pagination making a requests that return multiple items will be limited to 25 results by default. You can access other pages using the ?page paramater, you can also increase the amount of beers returned in each request by changing the ?per_page paramater.

# Get a beer 
Gets beers from the api, you can apply several filters using url paramaters, the available options are listed below.
to display it in the App with the information of the beer!


# React Native 
Using this example for getting the card and get information, in a best way I read it and code a better display information.
Note: If you are using react-native version 0.60 or higher you don't need to link react-native-vector-icons.

Wrap your root component in Provider from react-native-paper. If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to AppRegistry.registerComponent. 

If you don't want to install vector icons, you can use babel-plugin-optional-require to opt-out.

If you use Expo, you don't need to install vector icons. But if you have a babel.config.js or .babelrc file, make sure that it includes babel-preset-expo.
